I noticed that in the full schematic (pdf) that the slave ICs are 44 pin. The physical ones we are using are 40 pin.
Maybe this is fixed in the KiCad files but i need to update my KiCad to view them so I'm not sure.
If I'm right about this error not being corrected i suspect this is why version 1 of the PCBs failed.
